## SASS INSTALLATION SETUP
1. ### Initial Installation Attempt  
   Installed Sass using a specific version:  
   
   npm install sass -v 3.7.4
    
2. ### Version Check 
   Tried checking the installed Sass version:  
   
   sass --version
    
   This threw an error because the `sass` command wasn’t recognized—likely due to Sass being installed locally and not added to system PATH.

3. ### Resolved with Global Installation**  
   Reinstalled Sass globally to make the CLI accessible system-wide:  

   npm install -g sass@latest

   After this, Sass worked as expected, and `sass --version` returned the correct output.
